# Welcome to NI-edu
NI-edu is a collection of neuroimaging-related course materials developed at the University of Amsterdam. This website contains, at the moment, information about two courses, "fMRI-introduction" and "fMRI-pattern-analysis", which are completely free and open-source. The courses contain lectures, extensive computer labs/tutorials, and seminars. The materials documented here refer to the lectures (i.e., slides) and computer labs (i.e., interactive Jupyter notebooks).

Below, the contents of the two courses are described in more detail.

## fMRI-introduction
The purpose of this course is to teach you the basic concepts and methodology of functional MRI (fMRI) research. By the end of the course you will be able to walk through the full empirical cycle (design, acquisition, analysis and report) of an fMRI experiment. With regard to the type of analysis, this course focuses on standard univariate analysis. Also, you'll learn how to actually implement neuroimaging analyses, which is a fairly "technical" process, including working on Linux, programming, (relatively simple) mathematics, and statistics. So prepare to work with code, encounter mathematical formulas, and apply statistical models!

Below, you can find the topics listed per week.

* Week 1: Introduction to fMRI (lecture) + Python tutorial (lab)
* Week 2: GLM (lecture + lab)
* Week 3: GLM (lab) + design of experiments (lecture + lab)
* Week 4: Preprocessing (lecture + lab)
* Week 5: Multilevel analyses (lecture + lab)
* Week 6: Multiple comparisons correction + ROI analysis (lecture + lab)
* Week 7: Using [Nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/) for fMRI analysis and visualization (lab)

## fMRI-pattern-analyses
The purpose of this course is to learn how to implement "pattern analyses" for analysis of fMRI data. It discusses the two most prominent pattern analyses: machine-learning based 'decoding' and representational similarity analysis (RSA). At the end of the course, you will know when and why to use for the different types of analyses ('univariate' vs. decoding/RSA) and how to implement them. Note that it is meant as a follow-up course to fMRI-introduction.

Below, you can find the topics listed per week.

* Week 1: pattern estimation (+ recap nilearn)
* Week 2: machine learning ("decoding")
* Week 3: representational similarity analysis
* Week 4: final project (using publicly available data)
