    "Spatial filtering refers to operations applied to the *spatial* dimensions ($X$, $Y$, and $Z$) of our 4D data. The most common spatial filtering operation &mdash; spatial smoothing &mdash; is usually implemented using a \"3D gaussian (low-pass) smoothing kernel\". Sounds familiar? Well, it should, because it's essentially the same type of filter as we used for our temporal high-pass filter! Only this time, it's not a 1-dimensional gaussian (\"kernel\") that does the high-pass filtering, but it's a 3-dimensional gaussian that does *low-pass* filtering. Just like the temporal gaussian-weighted running line smoother is applied across time, we apply the 3D gaussian across space (i.e., the 3 spatial dimensions, $X$, $Y$, and $Z$). The figure below schematically visualized the process\\*:\n",

Therefore, we don't need to subtract the output from the `gaussian_filter` function from the (spatial) data! (If we'd would that, than we're effectively high-pass filtering the data!)\n",

    "Most functional MRI sequences use a technique called \"gradient-echo echo planar imaging\" (GE-EPI), which is a relatively sensitive and well-established technique for BOLD-MRI. For reasons beyond the scope of this course, GE-EPI scans unfortunately show signs of **\"geometric distortion\"** (sometimes called susceptibility distortion) and **signal loss** in some areas of the brain. Signal loss, which is most apparent in areas with B0 (static magnetic field) inhomogeneities caused by sudden air-tissue transitions (like around the ears, earduct &rarr; brain, and the ventromedial cortex, frontal sinus &rarr; brain). Geometric distortion is most visible in the phase-encoding direction of the scan (usually posterior &rarr; anterior or left &rarr; right). These geometric distorions are usually visible as tissue \"folding\" inwards or outwards (depending on the exact phase-encoding direction, e.g., posterior &rarr; anterior or anterior &rarr; posterior). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the gif below, you can see where signal loss (in ventromedial cortex and around the ears, best visible in slice `z=12`) and geometric distortion is most apparent.

Hover your cursor above the image to see it changing from uncorrected (\"before\") to corrected (\"after\").\n",

Most distortion correction techniques require you to acquire additional scans that can be used to correct (or \"unwarp\") your functional MRI scans. One technique is to acquire a \"fieldmap\" scan to image the homogeneity of the magnetic field (based on two scans with slightly different TEs) which can then be used for geometric correction. Another technique, often called \"topup unwarping\" (or PEPOLAR unwarping), uses one or more volumes of a separate functional MRI scan with the opposite phase-encoding direction as your to-be-correction functional MRI scan. In the \"topup\" scan, the distortion is expected to be in the complete opposite direction as in your to-be-correction fMRI scan (e.g., inward folding of tissue where the fMRI scan would show outward folding and vice versa), which can then be used to estimate an undistorted shape (which is \"in the middle\" of the fMRI and topup scan). \n",

As such, *motion correction* (or sometimes called *motion realignment*) is an important step in any preprocessing pipeline.

Before discussing motion correction in more detail, let's take a look at how a motion corrupted scan looks like. Actually, the data that we've been using so far (`data_4d`) actually has very little motion, so we're going to add some motion to it (with a custom function `add_motion_to_vols`).

    "## Anatomical realignment/registration and normalization\n",
    "So far, we discussed how to register volumes to a reference volume using rigid body registrations (with a six parameter affine) in the context of motion correction. This is, however, only the first step in the complete registration protocol of (most) studies. If your goal is, in the end, to perform some kind of group analysis (in which you pool together data from multiple subjects), you want to make sure that each voxel (at location $(X, Y, Z)$) is in (roughly) the same location in the brain. The problem is that people's brains differ quite a bit in terms of anatomy! Therefore, you need to register (transform) your subject-level (functional) data to some kind of common template. This process is often done in two stages: first, you compute a registration from (a reference volume of) your functional data (\"moving\") to your anatomical data (your high-resolution T1-weighted scan; \"fixed\"), and second you compute a registration from your anatomical data (\"moving\") to a common template (\"fixed\"). Then, you can register your functional data to the common template by sequentially applying the first and second stage registration parameters. This is visualized in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![reg](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vQEpo53zns0VHAgEBkEU9lqQ58RnqINqdUpdLDX-5X9pjLk_BNghfuPBp9zu2nRNzgVQBJZ4GuX5ejz/pub?w=1698&h=516)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure above, you can see that the first stage (BOLD &rarr; T1w) uses the same registration protocol as we used with motion-correction: an affine transformation with 6 parameters (translation and rotation in 3 directions; a \"rigid body registration\"). The second stage (T1w &rarr; template) also uses an affine transformation, but this time with 12 parameters. In addition to the 6 rigid body registration parameters, a 12 parameter affine (sometimes reffered to as an affine with 12 degrees-of-freedom, DOF) also includes global scaling in 3 directions (i.e., making the brain bigger of smaller) and shearing in 3 directions (i.e., \"stretching\" in 3 directions). These extra parameters attempt to overcome the anatomical differences between the individual subjects' brains and the template. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, only a 12 DOF affine is usually not sufficient for proper alignment. Therfore, most neuroimaging software packages also offer the option to apply a non-linear registration step (\"warping\") *on top of the 12 DOF affine registration*. Instead of globally transforming your \"moving\" volume (i.e., the transformation applies to each voxel equally), non-linear registrations allow for *local* transformations (i.e., some voxels might be transformed \"more\" than others). Usually, the combination of an initial 12 DOF affine and a non-linear (\"warping\") registration operation lead to a proper alignment of the subject's anatomical volume and the template."

    "Even after motion realignment, your data is still 'contaminated' by motion. This is because movement itself influences the measured activity. For example, suppose that you measure a single voxel in someone's brain; then, this person moves his/her head 2 centimeters. Now, we can do motion realigment to make sure we measure the same voxel before and after the movement, but *this does not change the fact that this particular voxel was originally measured at two different locations*. It could be that after the movement, the voxel was actually a little bit closer to the headcoil, which results in a (slight) increase in signal compared to before the movement (this is also known as \"spin history effects\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, you want to account for these interactions between motion and the measured activity. One way to do this is through \"motion filtering\", of which one popular approach is to simply add the 6 realignment parameters (rotation and translation in 3 directions) to the design-matrix ($X$)! In other words, we treat the motion realignment parameters as \"nuisance regressors\" that are aimed to explain activity that is related to motion. Realize that this is, thus, as temporal preprocessing step (which we discuss here instead of the previous notebook because we needed to explain motion correction first).\n",

    "As said in the beginning of this section, motion parameters (translation/rotation in 3 dimensions) are used as nuisance regressors in subject-level analyses. The reason for this is that, even after motion correction, the actual movement may have influenced the signal intensity through \"spin-history effects\", which occurs when a voxel is excited by an RF pulse slightly earlier/later due to movement (i.e., it may have moved up or down one slice), which changes how much T1 relaxation occurs (which affect the signal intensity; read more [here](http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/CommonArtefacts)).\n",

The most common way (in task-based fMRI) is to add the six motion parameters (rotation/translation in three directions) to your design. Any variance of your signal that covaries with (one or more of) these motion parameters will be accounted for (and will thus *not* end up in your noise term)."

    "Apart from directly adding the (extended) motion parameters to your design, you can also perform \"motion scrubbing\". Motion scrubbing is usually performed in resting-state analyses and is conceptually very similar to the \"despiking\" we did earlier. With motion scrubbing, you usually set a predefined threshold for your FD trace (for example 1 mm) and any timepoint above this threshold will be \"scrubbed out\". This is done by defining a separate regressor for each timepoint above the threshold containing all zeros except for the above-threshold timepoint, which contains a zero (just like we did with despiking). Sometimes, even the timepoint before and/or after the \"bad\" timepoint are additionally added to the design matrix. As this course focuses mostly on task-based fMRI analyses, we won't discuss motion scrubbing any further (but if you want to know more about the different motion correction strategies, we recommend the following article: [Power et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811914008702))."
