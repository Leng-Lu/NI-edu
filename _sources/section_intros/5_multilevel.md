# First & run-level analyses
In this section (corresponding to week 5 of the course), we discuss two things: first- and run-level analyses and how to run them using the software package [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki). This section contains three notebooks:

* [Linux and the command line](../fMRI-introduction/week_5/linux_and_the_command_line.ipynb)
* [First-level analyses](../fMRI-introduction/week_5/first_level_analyses.ipynb)
* [Run-level analyses](../fMRI-introduction/week_5/run_level_analyses.ipynb)

The *Linux and the command line* notebook gives an introduction to Linux and how to use the command line to run programs (such as FSL). Most of this tutorial can also be done on a Mac computer, but not on Windows. If you're not interested in running command-line programs such as FSL, this tutorial can safely be skipped.

The *First-level analyses* tutorial discusses how to implement and run first-level analyses (as discussed in the tutorials from this course thus far) in FSL. In additionally introduces you to the image viewer from FSl, [FSLeyes](https://users.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/~paulmc/fsleyes/userdoc/latest/), and introduces [the dataset](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003422) we will use in this tutorial and some of the following tutorials.

The *Run-level analyses* tutorial introduces the idea of the two-stage multilevel model approximation used in many univariate fMRI analyses and demonstrates how to run a run-level analysis in FSL.

```{warning}
The FSL-part of the *first-level analyses* notebooks requires about 350MB of data to be downloaded. The code to download the data is included in the notebook.
