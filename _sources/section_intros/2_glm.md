# Using the GLM to model fMRI data
In this section (corresponding to week 2 of the course), we will discuss the general linear model (GLM) and how to use it to analyze functional MRI data. This section contains two notebooks:

* [The GLM: estimation](../fMRI-introduction/week_2/glm_part1_estimation.ipynb)
* [The GLM: inference](../fMRI-introduction/week_3/glm_part2_inference.ipynb)

The *estimation* tutorial discusses the basics of multiple linear regression and how to estimate its parameters using ordinary least squares (OLS) as well as how to quantify model fit. The *inference* notebook discusses how to specify hypotheses using contrasts and how to statistically test these hypotheses by computing *t* and *p*-values.

Note that these two notebooks are quite extensive (especially the *estimation* tutorial) and may take longer to complete than the other tutorials in this course. In our "offline" course at the University of Amsterdam, we therefore have students do the *estimation* tutorial in week 2 and the *inference* notebook for week 3.
