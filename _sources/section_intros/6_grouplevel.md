# Group-level analyses
In this section (corresponding to week 6 of the course), we continue with discussing the multilevel model approach in fMRI analyses, but this time we'll extend it to group-level analyses (i.e., analyses across multiple participants). In addition, we will discuss the topic of multiple comparison correction and region-of-interest (ROI) analysis. This section contains three tutorials:

* [Group-level analyses](../fMRI-introduction/week_6/group_level_analyses.ipynb)
* [Multiple-comparison correction](../fMRI-introduction/week_6/MCC.ipynb)
* [ROI-analysis](../fMRI-introduction/week_6/ROI_analysis.ipynb)

The *group-level analyses* tutorial discusses how to extend the multi-stage model to data from multiple participants and how to implement this in FSL. 

The *Multiple-comparison correction* tutorial discusses the importance and implementation of different multiple-comparison correction techniques (in Python) using simulated data. 

Finally, the ROI-analysis tutorial discusses the reasons for and implementation of ROI analyses of fMRI data. In features both anatomical ROI analysis and functional ROI analysis (using [neurosynth](https://neurosynth.org/)).
