# Preprocessing
In this section (corresponding to week 4 of the course), we will discuss on of the most elaborate topics in fMRI analysis: preprocessing. This section contains three notebooks:

* [Temporal preprocessing](../fMRI-introduction/week_4/temporal_preprocessing.ipynb)
* [Spatial preprocessing](../fMRI-introduction/week_4/spatial_preprocessing.ipynb)
* [Fmriprep](../fMRI-introduction/week_4/fmriprep.ipynb)

The *temporal preprocessing* tutorial discusses the most common and important preprocessing steps in the time domain, such as high-pass filtering, prewhitening, and nuisance regression. 

The *spatial preprocessing* tutorial discusses the most common and important preprocessing steps in the spatial domain, such as spatial smoothing, motion correction, and anatomical realigment/normalization. 

The *Fmriprep* tutorial discusses the awesome [Fmriprep](https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/) software package for fMRI preprocessing and gives you some tips to get started with the package.
