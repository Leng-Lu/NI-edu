# Design of experiments
In this section (corresponding to week 3 of the course), we will discuss how to design considerations for fMRI experiments. This section contains two notebooks:

* [Design of experiments](../fMRI-introduction/week_3/design_of_experiments.ipynb)
* [Neurodesign](../fMRI-introduction/week_3/neurodesign.ipynb)

The *Design of experiments* notebook discusses the different statistical considerations (high predictor variance, low predictor covariance) and psychological factors (e.g., stimulus predictatibility) that affect design efficiency.

The *Neurodesign* notebook briefly explains the [Neurodesign](https://neurodesign.readthedocs.io/) Python package, which you can use to create optimal designs for your study.
