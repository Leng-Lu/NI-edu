# Python for (f)MRI analysis
In this section (corresponding to week 1 of the course), you will learn how to use Python for (f)MRI analysis. We assume that you are familiar with basic Python syntax and constructs and the Python packages *Matplotlib, *Pandas*, and *Numpy*. If not, [on the next page](../other/python_recap.md) we explain how to brush up your Python skills using a set of tutorials we developed for [another course](https://lukas-snoek.com/introPy) at the University of Amsterdam.

The [Working with MRI data in Python](../fMRI-introduction/week_1/python_for_mri.ipynb) tutorial in this section discusses the most used format to store MRI data, *nifti*, and discusses how to work with nifti files using the Python package [nibabel](https://nipy.org/nibabel/).
