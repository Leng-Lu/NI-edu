# Introduction to Nilearn
In the final section of the fMRI-introduction course (corresponding to week 7 of the course), we will discuss the Python package [nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/). This section contains two tutorials:

* [Introduction to Nilearn](../fMRI-introduction/week_7/nilearn.ipynb)
* [Statistics with Nilearn](../fMRI-introduction/week_7/nilearn_stats.ipynb)

The *Introduction to Nilearn* notebook introduces you to the awesome *Nilearn* package and how to use it to manipulate and visualize MRI data. The *Statistics with Nilearn* notebook specifically explains the GLM-related functionality of the Nilearn package.
