    "# Neurodesign (tutorial)\n",
    "In the previous tutorial, you have seen that jittered-ISI designs display quite some variance in efficiency (ranging from approx. 2.3 tot 3.1). This shows you that there are very many different designs possible, even with only two conditions, each associated with its own efficiency. Ideally, we want the **best** design (i.e., most efficient) out of all the possible designs. This is, however, for many (slightly more complex) designs not possible, because you would need to simulate billions of designs to exhaustively test them all! Moreover, we have also seen that high statistical efficiency (long blocked designs) may also have unwanted psychological effects (predictability, boredom).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how then should we look for (psychologically and statistically) efficient designs in the space of all possible designs? Fortunately, there exist methods to intelligently \"search\" for the optimal design among all possible designs without having to test them all and that allow you to define a balance between different aspects of your desired design. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many different packages exist that implement this type of \"design optimisation\" (like [optseq2](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/optseq2), and the MATLAB toolbox by [Kao](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v030i11)). Here, we will give a short demonstration of the \"neurodesign\" toolbox; `neurodesign` is a Python package, but they offer also a [web interface](http://neuropowertools.org/). Here, we will briefly walk you through the package. (Note that we use a slightly modified version of the original that works with Python3, which you can download [here](https://github.com/Neuroimaging-UvA/neurodesign).)"

We won't go into the specifics of the algorithm. \n",
