# Python for (f)MRI analysis
In this week, you will learn how to use Python for (f)MRI analysis. We assume that you are familiar with basic Python syntax and constructs and the Python packages *Matplotlib, *Pandas*, and *Numpy*. If not, [on the next page](../other/python_recap.md) we explain how to brush up your Python skills using a set of tutorials we developed for [another course](https://lukas-snoek.com/introPy) at the University of Amsterdam.
