As always, this depends on your specific research question, the type and quality of your data, and the type of analysis.\n",

    "The previous two weeks, you have learned that, essentially, we want to find large effects (calculated as *t*-values) of our contrasts by optimizing various parts of the *t*-value formula. Conceptually, the *t*-value formula for a particular contrast ($\\mathbf{c}$) can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "t\\mathrm{-value} = \\frac{\\mathrm{effect}}{\\mathrm{uncertainty}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{effect}}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{noise} \\cdot \\mathrm{design\\ variance}}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{c}\\hat{\\beta}}{\\sqrt{\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}\\mathbf{c}(\\mathbf{X}^{T}\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{c}^{T}}}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week you've learned that by ensuring low design variance (through *high* predictor variance and *low* predictor correlations) leads to larger normalized effects (higher *t*-values). This week, we will discuss the other term of the denominator of this formula: the noise (also called the residual variance or unexplained variance), which is defined in the *t*-value formula as follows:\n",

    "### On temporal vs. spatial preprocessing\n",
    "Roughly speaking, you can divide fMRI preprocessing into two types of operations: temporal and spatial. Temporal preprocessing involves operations that filter or otherwise affect the properties of your data across the time dimension (i.e., the time series). This is, of course, only applicable to *functional* MRI data (not structural or diffusion MRI). Examples of temporal operations are high-pass filtering and slice-time correction. Spatial preprocessing involves operations that filter or otherwise affect the spatial properties of your data (such as spatial orienatation, resolution, and shape). Examples of these spatial operations are spatial filtering (\"smoothing\"), distortion correction, motion correction (realignment), and spatial normalization/resampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll discuss these operations per theme: we'll start with temporal operations and then move to spatial operations. Note that this *is not* the order in which data is usually preprocessed (see page 35 of the \"Handbook of functional MRI Data Anslysis\" textbook).\n",

    "### Slice-time correction\n",
    "Slice-time correction is a temporal resampling technique that corrects for the fact that, in (most) BOLD-MRI scan sequences, volumes are acquired slice by slice. This means that each slices is acquired at a slightly different time. For example, suppose that we are acquiring an fMRI run with a TR of 2 seconds and our volumes consist of 40 slices (acquired axially, inferior &rarr; superior). In this case, the acquisition of each slice takes $\\frac{TR}{N_{slice}} = \\frac{2}{40} = 0.05$ seconds (let's call this `dt`). This means that, for the very first volume, the \"onset\" of the first slice is at 0 seconds (and lasts until 0.05 seconds), while the onset of the last slice is at 1.95 (and lasts until 2.00 seconds). In code, we can calculate these slice onsets **within a volume** using the `np.linspace(start, stop, n_steps)` function:"

For example, one of the videos showed that you could apply a high-pass filter by applying a \"gaussian weighted running line smoother\" (the method FSL employs) *directly* on the signal (method 1) **or** you could add \"low-frequency (drift) predictors\" to the design matrix (method 2; in the video they used a 'discrete cosine basis set'; the SPM method). In practice, both methods often yield very similar resuls. The most important thing to understand is that both methods are trying to accomplish the same goal: reduce the noise term of the model.\n",

    "### High-pass filtering of fMRI data (option 2)\n",
    "As we've seen, high-pass filtering using a \"running line smoother\" is an operation that is applied to the signal directly (before model fitting) to reduce the noise term. Another way to reduce the noise term is to include *noise regressors* (also called 'nuisance variables/regressors') in the design matrix. As such, we can subdivide our design matrix into \"predictors of interest\" (which are included to model the task/stimuli) and \"noise predictors\" (which aim to model the thus-far unmodelled variance). These \"noise predictors\" are also sometimes called \"nuisance\" predictors/regressors/covariates. We can now slightly reformulate our linear regression equation by dividing our design into two components, $\\mathbf{X}_{\\mathrm{interest}}$ and $\\mathbf{X}_{\\mathrm{noise}}$:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We can use this technique, which we'll call \"nuisance regression\" (which we'll discuss in more detail later), as an alternative to directly high-pass filtering the signal ($\\mathbf{y}$). One example of this (with respect to high-pass filtering) is including a series of cosines with varying frequencies in your design, which have the same effect as a high-pass filter. This type of filter is called a \"discrete cosine (basis) set\". Basically, for any given high-pass cutoff (in hertz), the \"discrete cosine transform\" (DTC) will yield a set of cosine regressors that is sufficient to filter out any frequency slower than your cutoff.\n",

    "## (More on) nuisance regression\n",
    "Let's go back to the technique of nuisance regression. We have seen before that this technique can be used to model low-frequency components in our data (effectively functioning as a high-pass filter), but it can, in general, be used to model *any* thus-far unmodelled variance in the signal that would otherwise end up in the noise term. For example, people use this technique to model variance due to physiological processes (such cardiac and respiratory related signals; see e.g. [Glover et al., 2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10893535)), motion-related variance (which we'll discuss later), and high-intensity \"spikes\". To get a better feel for nuisance regression and its consequences, let's look at this process of removing high-intensity spikes (which is sometimes called \"despiking\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using nuisance regression for despiking\n",
    "This technique of adding noise-predictors to the design matrix is sometimes used to model 'gradient artifacts', which are also called 'spikes' (which you've heard about in one of the videos for this week). This technique is also sometimes called \"despiking\". These spikes reflect sudden large intensity increases in the signal across the entire brain that likely reflect scanner instabilities. One way to deal with these artifacts is to \"censor\" bad timepoints (containing the spike) in your signal using a noise predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what defines a 'spike'/bad timepoint? One way is to compute the normalized \"root mean square successive differences\" (RMSSD), normalizing this, and imposing some threshold above which a timepoint is marked as a spike (technically, it's a little bit more complex, but we'll ignore that for now).\n",

    "## Spatial preprocessing\n",
    "Alright, so in the previoussections we've looked at how to filter our signal in the time-domain through high-pass filtering, prewhitening, and nuisance regression. Importantly, these operations are *performed on the timeseries of each voxel separately* (like you did in a previous ToDo)! Essentially, given our 4D fMRI data ($X \\times Y \\times Z \\times T$), temporal filtering as we discussed here is only applied to the fourth dimension (the time-dimension, $T$).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these temporal operations, there are several spatial operations performed on (f)MRI data, including spatial smoothing (a form of filtering), distortion correction, and spatial registration/resampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spatial filtering (smoothing)\n",
    "Spatial filtering refers to operations applied to the *spatial* dimensions ($X$, $Y$, and $Z$) of our 4D data. The most common spatial filtering operation &mdash; spatial smoothing &mdash; is usually implemented using a \"3D gaussian (low-pass) smoothing kernel\". Sounds familiar? Well, it should, because it's essentially the same type of filter as we used for our temporal high-pass filter! Only this time, it's not a 1-dimensional gaussian (\"kernel\") that does the high-pass filtering, but it's a 3-dimensional gaussian that does *low-pass* filtering. Just like the temporal gaussian-weighted running line smoother is applied across time, we apply the 3D gaussian across space (i.e., the 3 spatial dimensions, $X$, $Y$, and $Z$). The figure below schematically visualized the process\\*:\n",

    "\n",
    "(Note that we show the spatial data in 2D, simply because it's easier to visualize, but in reality this is always 3D!)\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, because both (high-pass) temporal filtering and (low-pass) spatial filtering in most fMRI applications depend on the same \"gaussian filtering\" principle, we can even use the same Python function: `gaussian_filter`! However, as we mentioned before, spatial smoothing in fMRI is used as a *low-pass filter*, which means that the (spatial!) frequencies *higher* than a certain cutoff are filtered out, while the (spatial!) frequencies *lower* than this cut-off are *passed*. Therefore, we don't need to subtract the output from the `gaussian_filter` function from the (spatial) data! (If we'd would that, than we're effectively high-pass filtering the data!)\n",

    "### Susceptibility distortion correction (SDC)\n",
    "Most functional MRI sequences use a technique called \"gradient-echo echo planar imaging\" (GE-EPI), which is a relatively sensitive and well-established technique for BOLD-MRI. For reasons beyond the scope of this course, GE-EPI scans unfortunately show signs of **\"geometric distortion\"** (sometimes called susceptibility distortion) and **signal loss** in some areas of the brain. Signal loss, which is most apparent in areas with B0 (static magnetic field) inhomogeneities caused by sudden air-tissue transitions (like around the ears, earduct &rarr; brain, and the ventromedial cortex, frontal sinus &rarr; brain). Geometric distortion is most visible in the phase-encoding direction of the scan (usually posterior &rarr; anterior or left &rarr; right). These geometric distorions are usually visible as tissue \"folding\" inwards or outwards (depending on the exact phase-encoding direction, e.g., posterior &rarr; anterior or anterior &rarr; posterior). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the gif below, you can see where signal loss (in ventromedial cortex and around the ears, best visible in slice `z=12`) and geometric distortion is most apparent. The \"before\" image is the one *with* geometric distortion (most apparent as folding inwards of the cerebellum and frontal cortex). Hover your cursor above the image to see it changing from uncorrected (\"before\") to corrected (\"after\").\n",

    "While there is (currently) no way to correct for signal loss, there *are* ways to correct for geometric distortion (as you can see in the gif above). Most distortion correction techniques require you to acquire additional scans that can be used to correct (or \"unwarp\") your functional MRI scans. One technique is to acquire a \"fieldmap\" scan to image the homogeneity of the magnetic field (based on two scans with slightly different TEs) which can then be used for geometric correction. Another technique, often called \"topup unwarping\" (or PEPOLAR unwarping), uses one or more volumes of a separate functional MRI scan with the opposite phase-encoding direction as your to-be-correction functional MRI scan. In the \"topup\" scan, the distortion is expected to be in the complete opposite direction as in your to-be-correction fMRI scan (e.g., inward folding of tissue where the fMRI scan would show outward folding and vice versa), which can then be used to estimate an undistorted shape (which is \"in the middle\" of the fMRI and topup scan). \n",

As such, *motion correction* (or sometimes called *motion realignment*) is an important step in any preprocessing pipeline.

Before discussing motion correction in more detail, let's take a look at how a motion corrupted scan looks like. Actually, the data that we've been using so far (`data_4d`) actually has very little motion, so we're going to add some motion to it (with a custom function `add_motion_to_vols`).

    "### Anatomical realignment/registration and normalization\n",
    "So far, we discussed how to register volumes to a reference volume using rigid body registrations (with a six parameter affine) in the context of motion correction. This is, however, only the first step in the complete registration protocol of (most) studies. If your goal is, in the end, to perform some kind of group analysis (in which you pool together data from multiple subjects), you want to make sure that each voxel (at location $(X, Y, Z)$) is in (roughly) the same location in the brain. The problem is that people's brains differ quite a bit in terms of anatomy! Therefore, you need to register (transform) your subject-level (functional) data to some kind of common template. This process is often done in two stages: first, you compute a registration from (a reference volume of) your functional data (\"moving\") to your anatomical data (your high-resolution T1-weighted scan; \"fixed\"), and second you compute a registration from your anatomical data (\"moving\") to a common template (\"fixed\"). Then, you can register your functional data to the common template by sequentially applying the first and second stage registration parameters. This is visualized in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![reg](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vQEpo53zns0VHAgEBkEU9lqQ58RnqINqdUpdLDX-5X9pjLk_BNghfuPBp9zu2nRNzgVQBJZ4GuX5ejz/pub?w=1698&h=516)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure above, you can see that the first stage (BOLD &rarr; T1w) uses the same registration protocol as we used with motion-correction: an affine transformation with 6 parameters (translation and rotation in 3 directions; a \"rigid body registration\"). The second stage (T1w &rarr; template) also uses an affine transformation, but this time with 12 parameters. In addition to the 6 rigid body registration parameters, a 12 parameter affine (sometimes reffered to as an affine with 12 degrees-of-freedom, DOF) also includes global scaling in 3 directions (i.e., making the brain bigger of smaller) and shearing in 3 directions (i.e., \"stretching\" in 3 directions). These extra parameters attempt to overcome the anatomical differences between the individual subjects' brains and the template. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, only a 12 DOF affine is usually not sufficient for proper alignment. Therfore, most neuroimaging software packages also offer the option to apply a non-linear registration step (\"warping\") *on top of the 12 DOF affine registration*. Instead of globally transforming your \"moving\" volume (i.e., the transformation applies to each voxel equally), non-linear registrations allow for *local* transformations (i.e., some voxels might be transformed \"more\" than others). Usually, the combination of an initial 12 DOF affine and a non-linear (\"warping\") registration operation lead to a proper alignment of the subject's anatomical volume and the template."

For example, suppose that you measure a single voxel in someone's brain; then, this person moves his/her hea†d 2 centimeters. Now, we can do motion realigment to make sure we measure the same voxel before and after the movement, but *this does not change the fact that this particular voxel was originally measured at two different locations*. It could be that after the movement, the voxel was actually a little bit closer to the headcoil, which results in a (slight) increase in signal compared to before the movement (this is also known as 'spin history effects').\n",

    "Apart from directly adding the (extended) motion parameters to your design, you can also perform \"motion scrubbing\". Motion scrubbing is usually performed in resting-state analyses and is conceptually very similar to the \"despiking\" we did earlier. With motion scrubbing, you usually set a predefined threshold for your FD trace (for example 1 mm) and any timepoint above this threshold will be \"scrubbed out\". This is done by defining a separate regressor for each timepoint above the threshold containing all zeros except for the above-threshold timepoint, which contains a zero (just like we did with despiking). Sometimes, even the timepoint before and/or after the \"bad\" timepoint are additionally added to the design matrix. As this course focuses mostly on task-based fMRI analyses, we won't discuss motion scrubbing any further (but if you want to know more about the different motion correction strategies, we recommend the following article: [Power et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811914008702))."

    "## Fmriprep\n",
    "*This is an optional section!*\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, many excellent general-purpose, open-source neuroimaging software packages exist: [SPM](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) (Matlab-based), [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki), [AFNI](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/), and [Freesurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) (with a shell interface). We argue that there is not one single package that is always the best choice for every step in your preprocessing pipeline. Fortunately, people from the [Poldrack lab](https://poldracklab.stanford.edu/) created [fmriprep](https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a software package that offers a preprocessing pipeline which \"glues together\" functionality from different neuroimaging software packages (such as Freesurfer and FSL), such that each step in the pipeline is executed by the software package that (arguably) does it best.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been using *Fmriprep* for preprocessing of our own data and we strongly recommend it. It is relatively simple to use, requires minimal user intervention, and creates extensive visual reports for users to do visual quality control (to check whether each step in the pipeline worked as expected). The *only* requirement to use Fmriprep is that your data is formatted as specified in the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### The BIDS-format\n",
    "[BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) is a specification on how to format, name, and organize your MRI dataset. It specifies the file format of MRI files (i.e., compressed Nifti: `.nii.gz` files), lays out rules for how you should name your files (i.e., with \"key-value\" pairs, such as: `sub-01_ses-1_task-1back_run-1_bold.nii.gz`), and outlines the file/folder structure of your dataset (where each subject has its own directory with separate subdirectories for different MRI modalities, including fieldmaps, functional, diffusion, and anatomical MRI). Additionally, it specifies a way to include \"metadata\" about the (MRI) files in your dataset with [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) files: plain-text files with key-value pairs (in the form \"parameter: value\"). Given that your dataset is BIDS-formatted and contains the necessary metadata, you can use `fmriprep` on your dataset. (You can use the awesome [bids-validator](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-validator/) to see whether your dataset is completely valid according to BIDS.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different tools to convert your \"raw\" scanner data (e.g., in DICOM or PAR/REC format) to BIDS, including [heudiconv](https://heudiconv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [bidscoin](https://github.com/Donders-Institute/bidscoin), and [bidsify](https://github.com/NILAB-UvA/bidsify) (created by Lukas). We'll skip over this step and assume that you'll be able to convert your data to BIDS."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Installing Fmriprep\n",
    "Now, having your data in BIDS is an important step in getting started with Fmriprep. The next step is installing the package. Technically, Fmriprep is a Python package, so it can be installed as such (using `pip install fmriprep`), but we do not recommend this \"bare metal\" installation, because it depends on a host of neuroimaging software packages (including FSL, Freesurfer, AFNI, and ANTs). So if you'd want to directly install Fmriprep, you'd need to install those extra neuroimaging software packages as well (which is not worth your time, trust us).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, Fmriprep also offers a \"Docker container\" in which Fmriprep and all the associated dependencies are already installed. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is software that allows you to create \"containers\", which are like lightweight \"virtual machines\" ([VM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine)) that are like a separate (Linux-based) operating system with a specific software configuration. You can download the Fmriprep-specific docker \"image\", which is like a \"recipe\", build the Fmriprep-specific \"container\" according to this \"recipe\" on your computer, and finally use this container to run Fmriprep on your computer as if all dependencies were actually installed on your computer! Docker is available on Linux, Mac, and Windows. To install Docker, google something like \"install docker for {Windows,Mac,Linux}\" to find a google walkthrough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you need administrator (\"root\") privilege on your computer (which is likely the case for your own computer, but not on shared analysis servers) to run Docker. If you don't have root access on your computer/server, ask you administrator/sysadmin to install [singularity](https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#singularity-container), which allows you to convert Docker images to Singularity images, which you can run without administrator privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you have installed Docker, you can run the \"containerized\" Fmriprep from your command line directly, which involves a fairly long and complicated command (i.e., `docker run -it --rm -v bids_dir /data ... etc`), or using the `fmriprep-docker` Python package. This `fmriprep-docker` package is just a simple wrapper around the appropriate Docker command to run the complicated \"containerized\" Fmriprep command. We strongly recommend this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install `fmriprep-docker`, you can use `pip` (from your command line):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install fmriprep-docker\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you should have access to the `fmriprep-docker` command on your command line and you're ready to start preprocessing your dataset. For more detailed information about installing Fmriprep, check out their [website](https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Running Fmriprep\n",
    "Assuming you have Docker and `fmriprep-docker` installed, you're ready to run Fmriprep. The basic format of the `fmriprep-docker` command is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "fmriprep-docker <your bids-folder> <your output-folder> \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that `fmriprep-docker` has two mandatory positional arguments: the first one being your BIDS-folder (i.e., the path to your folder with BIDS-formattefd data), and the second one being the output-folder (i.e., where you want Fmriprep to output the preprocessed data). We recommend setting your output-folder to a subfolder of your BIDS-folder named \"derivatives\": `<your bids-folder>/derivatives`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you can add a bunch of extra \"flags\" (parameters) to the command to specify the preprocessing pipeline as you like it. We highlight a couple of important ones here, but for the full list of parameters, check out the [Fmriprep](https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html) website.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Freesurfer\n",
    "When running Fmriprep from Docker, you don't need to have Freesurfer installed, but you *do* need a Freesurfer license. You can download this here: https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/License. Then, you need to supply the `--fs-license-file <path to license file>` parameter to your `fmriprep-docker` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "fmriprep-docker <your bids-folder> <your output-folder> --fs-license-file /home/lukas/license.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Configuring what is preprocessed\n",
    "If you just run Fmriprep with the mandatory BIDS-folder and output-folder arguments, it will preprocess everything it finds in the BIDS-folder. Sometimes, however, you may just want to run one (or several) specific participants, or one (or more) specific tasks (e.g., only the MRI files associated with the localizer runs, but not the working memory runs). You can do this by adding the `--participant` and `--task` flags to the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "fmriprep-docker <your bids-folder> <your output-folder> --participant sub-01 --task localizer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also specify some things to be ignored during preprocessing using the `--ignore` parameters (like `fieldmaps`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "fmriprep-docker <your bids-folder> <your output-folder> --ignore fieldmaps\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling performance\n",
    "It's very easy to parallelize the preprocessing pipeline by setting the `--nthreads` and `--omp-nthreads` parameters, which refer to the number of threads that should be used to run Fmriprep on. Note that laptops usually have 4 threads available (but analysis servers usually have more!). You can also specify the maximum of RAM that Fmriprep is allowed to use by the `--mem_mb` parameters. So, if you for example want to run Fmriprep with 3 threads and a maximum of 3GB of RAM, you can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "fmriprep-docker <your bids-folder> <your output-folder> --nthreads 3 --omp-nthreads 3 --mem_mb 3000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In our experience, however, specifying the `--mem_mb` parameter is rarely necessary if you don't parallelize too much. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output spaces\n",
    "Specifying your \"output spaces\" (with the `--output-spaces` flag) tells Fmriprep to what \"space(s)\" you want your preprocessed data registered to. For example, you can specify `T1w` to have your functional data registered to the participant's T1 scan. You can, instead or in addition to, also specify some standard template, like the MNI template (`MNI152NLin2009cAsym` or `MNI152NLin6Asym`). You can even specify surface templates if you want (like `fsaverage`), which will sample your volumetric functional data onto the surface (as computed by freesurfer). In addition to the specific output space(s), you can add a resolution \"modifier\" to the parameter to specify in what spatial resolution you want your resampled data to be. Without any resolution modifier, the native resolution of your functional files (e.g., $3\\times3\\times3$ mm.) will be kept intact. But if you want to upsample your resampled files to 2mm, you can add `YourTemplate:2mm`. For example, if you want to use the FSL-style MNI template (`MNI152NLin6Asym`) resampled at 2 mm, you'd use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "fmriprep-docker <your bids-folder> <your output-folder> --output-spaces MNI152NLin6Asym:2mm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can of course specify multiple output-spaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "fmriprep-docker <your bids-folder> <your output-folder> --output-spaces MNI152NLin6Asym:2mm T1w fsaverage\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other parameters\n",
    "There are many options that you can set when running Fmriprep. Check out the [Fmriprep website](https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/) (under \"Usage\") for a list of all options!"
