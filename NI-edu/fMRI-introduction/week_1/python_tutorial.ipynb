    "# Python (for MRI analysis)\n",
    "This week's tutorial is about the programming language Python and how to use it for neuroimaging analysis. First, we'll discuss \"Jupyter notebooks\" and how to use them in this course. Then, we'll discuss some basic Python syntax and constructs; this should be doable for students who are comfortable with programming (e.g., from previous experience with other programming languages, like Matlab or R). After discussing basic Python syntax, we'll go over \"numpy\" (Python's scientific computing package), followed by a section on \"Matplotlib\" (Python's main plotting package). Finally, this tutorial ends with a section on how to interact with Nifti files &mdash; the file format used most in the MRI community.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you'll learn**: after this week's lab ... \n",
    "\n",
    "* you know how to work with Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "* you understand Python's basic syntax\n",
    "* you know how to leverage Numpy's powerful array-based functionality\n",
    "* you can plot data in various ways using Matplotlib\n",
    "* you know how to load, manipulate, and analyze Nifti-files\n",

    "## Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what are Jupyter notebooks, actually? Basically, using Jupyter notebooks is like using the web-browser as a kind of editor from which you can run Python code, similar to the MATLAB interactive editor or RStudio. Just like any editor, code in Jupyter notebooks is interpreted and executed by Python software on your computer (or on the UvA \"TUX\" server, if you're following this course as part of the research master).\n",
    "\n",
    "The cool thing about these notebooks is that they allow you to mix code \"cells\" (see below) and text \"cells\" (such as this one). The (printed) output from code blocks are displayed right below the code blocks themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks have two **modes**: edit mode and command mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Command mode* is indicated by a grey cell border with a blue left margin (as is the case now!): When you are in command mode, you are able to edit the notebook as a whole, but not type into individual cells. Most importantly, in command mode, the keyboard is mapped to a set of shortcuts that let you perform notebook and cell actions efficiently (some shortcuts in command mode will be discussed later!). Enter command mode by pressing **Esc** or using the mouse to click outside a cell’s editor area; <br><br>\n",
    "- *Edit mode* is indicated by a green cell border and a prompt showing in the editor area: When a cell is in edit mode, you can type into the cell, like a normal text editor. Enter edit mode by pressing Enter or using the mouse to double-click on a cell’s editor area.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're reading and scrolling through the tutorials, you'll be in the command mode mostly. But once you have to program (or write) stuff yourself, you have to switch to edit mode. But we'll get to that. First, we'll explain something about the two types of cells: code cells and text cells."

    "### Code cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Code cells are the place to write your Python code, similar to MATLAB 'code sections' (which are usually deliniated by %%). Importantly, unlike the interactive editors in RStudio and MATLAB, a code cell in Jupyter notebooks can only be run all at once. This means you cannot run it line-by-line, but you have to run the entire cell!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running cells\n",
    "Let's look at an example. Below, you see a code-cell with two print-statements. To run the cell, select it (i.e., the cell should have a green or blue frame around it; doesn't matter whether you're in edit or command mode), and click on the \"&#9654; `Run`\" icon or press `ctr+Enter`). Try it with the cell below!"

You know your notebook 'crashed' when stopping the cell (&#9632;) does not work and your cell continues its execution, as evident by the `In [*]:` prompt next to the cell. In those cases, you need to completely restart the notebook, or in programming lingo: you need to \"restart the kernel\". To do so, click `Kernel` and `Restart`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, when you restart the kernel, it will keep all text/code that you've written, but it will **not** remember all the variables that you defined before restarting the kernel, including the imports.

    "* the [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) package provides functionality for scientific computing (e.g. statistics, signal processing);\n",

    "* the [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) package provides plotting functions;\n",
    "* and various specialied neuroimaging packages provide functionality to work and analyze (f)MRI (e.g. [nibabel](http://nipy.org/nibabel/) and [nipype](http://nipy.org/nipype)) and MEG/EEG (e.g. [MNE](http://www.martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html)).\n",

For example, here at the UvA, we have a Philips scanner and we often export our data as PAR/REC files. However, to streamline the development and use of neuroimaging software packages, the Neuroimaging InFormatics Technology Initiative came up with a new, standardized format, *nifti*, that most neuroimaging packages should support. As such, usually the first step in any (f)MRI preprocessing pipeline is to convert the scanner-specific files (e.g., PAR/RECs) to nifti. This is beyond the scope of this course, but if at one point you need to do this yourself, we highly recommed the [dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix) package!\n",

    "Throughout these tutorials you'll work with these nifti-files (also called nifti images), which you can recognize by their extension of *.nii* or its compressed version *.nii.gz*. This file-format is supported by most neuroimaging software packages (such as FSL, which you'll use later in this course!). \n",
    "\n",

Many procedures we'll discuss in the rest of the course (such as fMRI preprocessing and analysis) can also, and more efficiently, be implemented using <a href=\"https://nilearn.github.io/\">Nilearn</a>, a Python package for fast and easy statistical learning on neuroimaging data.
